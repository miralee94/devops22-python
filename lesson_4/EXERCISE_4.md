# Exercise 4

## Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to learn about loops and control flow.

### `Exercise 1` even or odd

Write a program that fulfills the specification:

1. Ask the user for a integer
2. If the integer is even, print even
3. If the integer is odd, print odd

### `Exercise 2` VIP

Write a program that fulfills the specification:

1. Ask the user for a name
2. Create a tuple with at least five names
3. If the user input is in the tuple, print the text "Welcome {name} your are on the list".
4. If the user input is not in the tuple, print "Sorry, you are not on the list".

### `Exercise 3` Repeat word

Write a program that fulfills the specification:

1. Ask the user for a word
2. Print the word x times, where x = len(word). i.e if the word is `hello` the program writes:

    ```text
    hello
    hello
    hello
    hello
    hello
    ```

<div class="page"/>

### `Exercise 4` Sum

Write a program that fulfills the specification:

1. Ask the user for a start and stop integer
2. Print every integer between start and stop. i.e. start = 1, stop = 5 would print:

    ```text
    1
    2
    3
    4  
    ```

3. Print the sum of all integers i.e

    ```text
    Sum: 10
    ```

### `Exercise 5` Until stop

Write a program that fulfills the specification:

1. Create a while loop that runs forever
2. In each iteration, input a text
3. In each iteration, print a text "Enter `stop` to quit: "
4. If the text equals stop, break the while loop
5. If the text don't equals stop, print the text and the length of the text
