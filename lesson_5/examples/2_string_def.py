"""
A string is a sequence of values that represent Unicode code points.
All the code points in the range U+0000 - U+10FFFF can be represented in a string.
Python doesnâ€™t have a char type; instead,
every code point in the string is represented as a string object with length 1.
The built-in function ord() converts a code point from its string form to an integer in the range 0 - 10FFFF;
chr() converts an integer in the range 0 - 10FFFF to the corresponding length 1 string object.
str.encode() can be used to convert a str to bytes using the given text encoding,
and bytes.decode() can be used to achieve the opposite.
